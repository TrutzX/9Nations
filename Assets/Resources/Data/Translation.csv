generalDesc,Hello!;;Nice to meet you. I'm Sven and develop 9 Nations. It is a tuned-based strategy game. You have to explore the area and develop your kingdoms.
betaDesc,Hello;;This version starts a different kind of play. Your nation will later develop elements. At the moment their are two options. In this state the game does not contains all features at the moment. This means that you can encounter bugs; crashes; incomplete and unpolished features etc. also except balancing issuses.;;If you have found any mistakes; bugs oder you have questions use the feedback button. I'm happy to hear from you.;;Greetings Sven
privacyDesc,Please take a look at the website https://9nations.de/privacy-policy/privacy-policy-in-game/
newDesc,Hello;;this update brings items and a second tutorial and much rebalancing and some ui improvements. To understand 9 nations play the tutorial. You can find it in the campaign menu.;;You can find the new features on the website https://9nations.de
researchDesc,You never know what you will discover during research. Research in 9N also functions this way. You choose different elements or a combination of them and start researching. The more elements you combine the longer the research will take. The greater is the chance of researching something. If I only do research light you will discover the baracks. If you combine light and light you can also discover the bigger village hall or the baracks.
unitDesc,Units are (besides buildings) essential to the game. When clicked you can moved them with the arrow keys which costs action points (AP). You can also perform various actions which costs AP. At the end of each round the AP will be refilled.;;Units are always supplied by the nearest city. Also they use the resources of this city.
buildingDesc,Buildings are (besides the units) basic to the game. If they are clicked actions can be performed which costs action points (AP). At the end of each round the AP is replenished.;;Buildings are always part of a city. The closest city is automatically selected during construction.
townDesc,A city is a collection of buildings with shared resources. A city also manages all units that are in its area.;;Cities always have a center which is represented by the town hall. The city can be levelled if the town hall is upgraded. This allowed to build more and different buildings but also your inhabitens demands more resources.
developElementDesc,You can use a ready-made nation or develop your own. If you want to develop your own you have to decide with which element you want to develop your nation. Each element gives you different units; buildings; abilities and access to other elements. In total you can develop in 4 elements.
androidDesc,The support for android is at the moment very limited  so no tooltips and mods are supported. If you find any bugs or display issues please contact us.
